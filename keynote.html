								<h5>Speaker Bio
							</strong></h5>
							Professor Tak-Wai Chan is a trailblazer in digital learning and a global leader in the
							field. Almost 40 years ago, at a time when computers and the internet were not yet
							mainstream in the mid-eighties, he began researching on AI supported learning for his
							doctoral dissertation, proposing a new genus of AI in education system called learning
							companion system in 1988. This virtual companion system, called Integration-Kid, was the
							first artificial companion in the world. In 1989, he and his students started to build the
							world's first dedicated networked learning system for collaborative learning and learning
							through competition games, called Distributed West (1992). In early 2000s, he and his
							colleagues built the largest online learning community called EduCity (1.5 million learners
							with 1,700 schools involved in 2003), which was also referred as the first learning society
							in the world. In the same time period, his team conducted frontier research on mobile
							learning, intelligent classroom, future classroom, interactive clicker, e-schoolbag,
							one-to-one technology enhanced learning, and so forth. After this series of research, in
							2006, working together with a large group of international researchers mainly from the
							Western countries, he proposed the concept of Seamless Learning. In 2010s, after some
							long-term experiments on reading (MSSR) and writing in one-to-one technology enhanced
							classroom, in collaboration with a group of Asian scholars, he proposed the Interest-Driven
							Creator (IDC) Theory. Again, he is now calling for an international researcher team to build
							the Seamless Interest-Driven Creator (SIDC) Theory.<br><br>
							In addition to his research, Professor Chan has also been a major founder of two societies:
							the Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education (APSCE) and the Global Chinese Society
							for Computers in Education (GCSCE). These two societies respectively host annual conference
							series ICCEs and GCCCEs, as well as the journals RPTEL and JLCE. Moreover, to cope with the
							expanding research community of the field, he has been assisting the establishment of APSCE
							Theme-Based International Conference Series (TBICS), including CTE-STEM, ICFULL,
							MetaACES.<br><br>
							Throughout his career, Professor Chan has received numerous recognitions and academic
							awards, including the National Chair Professorship Award in 2020, the Executive Yuan Award
							for Outstanding Science and Technology Contribution in 2019, the Fellow of APSCE in 2019,
							the Academic Award of the Ministry of Education in 2013, the Pan Wen Yuan Foundation
							Outstanding Research Award in 2009, and the Chinese Foundation Award from the National
							Science Council in 2003. Besides being National Chair Professor, he has also held several
							distinguished positions, including Chair Professor at NCU since 2008, Distinguished
							Professor at NCU from 2004 to 2008, Excellent Appointed Researcher at the National Science
							Council in 2008, and Appointed Researcher at the National Science Council from 2000 to 2007.
							Additionally, he has received Excellent Research Awards from the National Science Council
							for the years 1995-1996, 1997-1998, and 1999-2000.<br><br>
							Throughout his career, Professor Chan has received numerous recognitions and academic
							awards: the National Chair Professorship Award in 2020, the Executive Yuan Award for
							Excellent Science and Technology Contribution in 2019, the Fellow of APSCE in 2019, the Pan
							Wen Yuan Foundation Excellent Researcher Award in 2009, among others.

							<!-- <h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
							<h6 class="morespace" style="text-align: justify;">Human lifespan is extended, but COVID-19
								global death toll has exceeded 8 million (Our World in Data, 2023); digitization enables
								all of us to connect and communicate, but we constantly quarrel over different beliefs;
								online games immerse players, but children's addiction may become a learning disaster;
								artificial companions (such as chatbots and robots) can do various kinds of work for us,
								but they also replace many of our jobs; the advent of metaverse may represent a bright
								future world, but it may also signal a dark abyss to come; artificial intelligence can
								improve human life in the future, but it can also do stupid things to human beings; we
								cheer for technological progress, but we worry about climate change, natural resource
								depletion, environmental pollution, wealth disparity and other problems.<br><br>
								The world is on the brink of peril. Shall we live in harmony with the world around us?
								What is the future of human wellbeing? What role can education play? Mandela said:
								“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Education
								is the hope of the future. The destiny of all human beings in the future is decided by
								today's education. In 2040, in their 30s, the current primary and secondary school
								students will be the pillars of our society. <br><br>
								On the other hand, progress of digital technology, such as metaverse and artificial
								companions, accelerates, with its impacts in the next 10 years several times as that of
								last 10 years’. Designing future education is designing the future world.<br><br>
								In 2006, 17 international researchers, mainly from Asia, Europe, and North America,
								published a paper on the concept of seamless learning that holistically describes future
								learning environment (Chan et al., 2006). Seamless learning is based on three other
								concepts: (1) one-to-one (1:1) technology enhanced learning, (2) learning scenarios, and
								(3) seamless learning space. Seamless learning spells out the continuality of learning
								experience while students switching from one scenario to another easily and quickly.
								Subsequently, the concept triggered abundant research (Looi et al., 2010; Wong & Looi,
								2011).<br><br>
								Starting from 2018, 12 years after the publication of seamless learning concept, 23
								Asian researchers collaborated and published a series of papers on Interest-Driven
								Creator Theory (IDC Theory) (Chan et al., 2018; Chan et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2020;
								Chen et al., 2020). This effort stemmed from the fact that a considerable part of Asian
								education remains examination-driven. The overemphasis on examination outcome distorts
								the processes of learning and teaching, ruinate students’ interest in learning,
								undermine the need of developing twenty-first century competencies, and fails to prepare
								our next generation to face the future unpredictable world. Yet, high-stakes
								examinations will not disappear in the foreseeable future. To lessen their drawbacks and
								guide the design of future learning, IDC Theory is developed.<br><br>
								Seamless learning speaks of future technology supported learning environment while IDC
								Theory focuses on learning activity design. It is noticeable that integration of them
								will simply form a theory about continuity of IDC-based learning in the future seamless
								learning space, and we shall call this Seamless IDC Theory (or SIDC Theory).<br><br>

								This talk intends to call for establishing SIDC Theory through collective endeavor by
								interested researchers. Besides, this talk also raises questions to be considered in
								building the theory:<br><br>
								1. How to develop a broad framework of SIDC Theory that can capture critical elements of
								the theory?<br><br>
								2. Will there be extension of seamless learning per se as well as that of IDC Theory per
								se in view of SIDC Theory and the digital future?<br><br>
								3. What is the ‘global educational goal’ that educators around the world should strive
								for? If so, will SIDC-based learning (or SIDC learning) contribute to the global
								educational goal?<br><br>
								4. In the ‘seamless world’ of the digital future, will there be SIDC work, SIDC family
								life, SIDC entertainment, and so forth, besides SIDC learning? Or will there be SIDC
								daily life?<br><br>
								Besides, this talk will also discuss some implications of SIDC Theory to MetaACES
								research.

									<h5>Speaker Bio
								</strong></h5>
								Chris Dede is a Senior Research Fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and
								was for 22 years its Timothy E. Wirth Professor in Learning Technologies. His fields of
								scholarship include emerging technologies, policy, and leadership. He is a Co-Principal
								Investigator of the NSF-funded National Artificial Intelligence Institute in Adult
								Learning and Online Education.
								<div class="separator small"></div>
								<h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
								<h6 class="morespace" style="text-align: justify;">We live at a time of rapid advances
									in both the capabilities and the cost of virtual reality (VR), multi-user virtual
									environments (MUVEs), and various forms of mixed reality (e.g., augmented reality
									(AR), digital puppeteering). These emerging media potentially offer extraordinary
									opportunities for enhancing both motivation and learning across a range of subject
									areas, student developmental levels, and educational settings. <br><br>
									Immersive media have affordances that enhance experiential learning based on a
									plan/act/reflect cycle. Psychological immersion is the mental state of being
									completely absorbed or engaged with something. For example, a well-designed game in
									a MUVE draws viewers into the metaverse portrayed on the screen, and they feel
									caught up in that virtual environment. The use of narrative and symbolism creates
									credible, engaging situations; each participant can influence what happens through
									their actions and can interact with others. Via richer stimuli, head-mounted or
									room-sized displays can create sensory immersion to deepen the effect of
									psychological immersion, as well as induce embodied virtual presence (place
									illusion), the feeling that you are at a location in the virtual world.<br><br>
									This talk will describe how the metaverse is powerful for “situated” learning:
									Experiences take place in the same or a similar virtual context to the real world
									setting in which skills and knowledge are later applied, and the virtual context
									itself fosters tacit learning through experience and modeling. However, learning in
									the metaverse faces challenges of simulator sickness, access by learners with
									limited vision, and limited bandwidth for non-verbal human interaction.
