								<h5>Speaker Bio
							</strong></h5>
							Tak-Wai Chan is Chair Professor of the Graduate Institute of Network Learning Technology at
							National Central University in Taiwan. He has worked on various areas of digital technology
							supported learning, including artificial intelligence in education, computer supported
							collaborative learning, digital classrooms, online learning communities, mobile and
							ubiquitous learning, digital game based learning, and, most recently, technology supported
							mathematics and language arts learning.

							<!-- <h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
							<h6 class="morespace" style="text-align: justify;">Human lifespan is extended, but COVID-19
								global death toll has exceeded 8 million (Our World in Data, 2023); digitization enables
								all of us to connect and communicate, but we constantly quarrel over different beliefs;
								online games immerse players, but children's addiction may become a learning disaster;
								artificial companions (such as chatbots and robots) can do various kinds of work for us,
								but they also replace many of our jobs; the advent of metaverse may represent a bright
								future world, but it may also signal a dark abyss to come; artificial intelligence can
								improve human life in the future, but it can also do stupid things to human beings; we
								cheer for technological progress, but we worry about climate change, natural resource
								depletion, environmental pollution, wealth disparity and other problems.<br><br>
								The world is on the brink of peril. Shall we live in harmony with the world around us?
								What is the future of human wellbeing? What role can education play? Mandela said:
								“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Education
								is the hope of the future. The destiny of all human beings in the future is decided by
								today's education. In 2040, in their 30s, the current primary and secondary school
								students will be the pillars of our society. <br><br>
								On the other hand, progress of digital technology, such as metaverse and artificial
								companions, accelerates, with its impacts in the next 10 years several times as that of
								last 10 years’. Designing future education is designing the future world.<br><br>
								In 2006, 17 international researchers, mainly from Asia, Europe, and North America,
								published a paper on the concept of seamless learning that holistically describes future
								learning environment (Chan et al., 2006). Seamless learning is based on three other
								concepts: (1) one-to-one (1:1) technology enhanced learning, (2) learning scenarios, and
								(3) seamless learning space. Seamless learning spells out the continuality of learning
								experience while students switching from one scenario to another easily and quickly.
								Subsequently, the concept triggered abundant research (Looi et al., 2010; Wong & Looi,
								2011).<br><br>
								Starting from 2018, 12 years after the publication of seamless learning concept, 23
								Asian researchers collaborated and published a series of papers on Interest-Driven
								Creator Theory (IDC Theory) (Chan et al., 2018; Chan et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2020;
								Chen et al., 2020). This effort stemmed from the fact that a considerable part of Asian
								education remains examination-driven. The overemphasis on examination outcome distorts
								the processes of learning and teaching, ruinate students’ interest in learning,
								undermine the need of developing twenty-first century competencies, and fails to prepare
								our next generation to face the future unpredictable world. Yet, high-stakes
								examinations will not disappear in the foreseeable future. To lessen their drawbacks and
								guide the design of future learning, IDC Theory is developed.<br><br>
								Seamless learning speaks of future technology supported learning environment while IDC
								Theory focuses on learning activity design. It is noticeable that integration of them
								will simply form a theory about continuity of IDC-based learning in the future seamless
								learning space, and we shall call this Seamless IDC Theory (or SIDC Theory).<br><br>

								This talk intends to call for establishing SIDC Theory through collective endeavor by
								interested researchers. Besides, this talk also raises questions to be considered in
								building the theory:<br><br>
								1. How to develop a broad framework of SIDC Theory that can capture critical elements of
								the theory?<br><br>
								2. Will there be extension of seamless learning per se as well as that of IDC Theory per
								se in view of SIDC Theory and the digital future?<br><br>
								3. What is the ‘global educational goal’ that educators around the world should strive
								for? If so, will SIDC-based learning (or SIDC learning) contribute to the global
								educational goal?<br><br>
								4. In the ‘seamless world’ of the digital future, will there be SIDC work, SIDC family
								life, SIDC entertainment, and so forth, besides SIDC learning? Or will there be SIDC
								daily life?<br><br>
								Besides, this talk will also discuss some implications of SIDC Theory to MetaACES
								research.

								<h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
								<h6 class="morespace" style="text-align: justify;">
									Generative AI is powering a new generation of pedagogical agents that are highly
									effective and can transform how people learn. Pedagogical agents are now more
									adaptive and personalized than has ever been possible before. They give learners
									opportunities to practice new skills in a safe environment, resulting in rapid
									learning gains and improved retention.<br />
									Generative AI is also transforming the workforce, and this poses challenges for
									training, education, and society at large. As organizations adopt generative AI,
									jobs are being transformed and entry-level positions are being eliminated.
									Pedagogical agents can help people quickly develop the skills that they will need to
									succeed in the workforce of the future, including people skills, critical thinking,
									and responsible use of AI.<br />
									This talk will discuss current trends in generative AI and pedagogical agents and
									also look toward the future, as generative AI expands its capabilities and is
									integrated into education and training.

									<h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
									<h6 class="morespace" style="text-align: justify;">
										The integration of immersive experiences into learning has reached a pivotal stage, coinciding with the emergence, accompanied by heightened expectations, of the metaverse and its promise to revolutionize social dynamics. Cultural institutions are actively exploring the metaverse&#39;s potential to enrich visitor engagement. In this keynote, I draw from case studies of extended reality applications, emphasizing their role as exploratory tools to foster reflexivity, sociality, hybridity, and historical empathy across diverse cultural landscapes. My aim is to address the complexities encountered during design and implementation, particularly focusing on aspects that may undermine the authenticity of social and cultural nuances within shared physical and virtual spaces. By examining both sophisticated XR applications and lower-end mobile applications, I showcase the evolution of immersive experiences evolving from didactic presentations to interactive, emotive, and socially engaging environments. Through leveraging interactive storytelling and participatory elements, immersive technologies in informal learning can facilitate deeper learning, reflective practices, and historical resonance while preserving the essence of human interaction.

										<h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
										<h6 class="morespace" style="text-align: justify;">
											Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been playing an essential role in
											language education. However, the recent emergence of generative AI models
											like ChatGPT and Midjourney has reignited interest in the potential of AI
											applications in education, prompting both excitement and caution. Generative
											AI holds considerable promise for revolutionizing education across various
											fronts. With the advent of the Metaverse era, hailed as a transformative
											phase in internet evolution, there's an urgent need for educators and
											researchers to reassess the relationship between humans and AI as we reshape
											our teaching, learning, and everyday experiences. As educators, it's
											imperative that we engage in open conversations about integrating the
											Metaverse and AI into language learning, topics that are currently at the
											forefront of academic discourse. In light of this, the speech will cover
											several key areas, including an introduction to the Metaverse and generative
											AI, their practical application in language learning, the opportunities they
											present, the challenges they pose, and recommendations for future research.
